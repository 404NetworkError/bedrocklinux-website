			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you would like features or packages available in
						Linux distributions, but not all available in the same
						Linux distribution at the same time.  For example, if
						you would like your system to be mostly stable and
						unchanging, like Debian or a Red Hat Enterprise Linux
						clone, but would like access to cutting-edge packages
						from Arch, Bedrock Linux can provide this
						simultaneously and transparently.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you would like to have access to other Linux
						distributions readily available for purposes other than
						access to their functionality.  For example, if you
						regularly assist people who use a variety of Linux
						distributions and would like to be able to test
						possible solutions on your own box without using
						virtual machines.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you have issues with packages from Linux
						distributions that are unique to that distribution
						and would rather simply use another distribution's
						package for this specific issue than debug the root
						of the problem.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you would like to try for extremely high uptime
						while still doing distro-upgrades if you are limited
						yourself to a single machine.  See <a href="#Why should%0A%09%09%09%09%09%09%09I not use Bedrock?">Why should I not use
							Bedrock?</a> below for the catch.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you want a toy with which to play.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="Why should I not use Bedrock?">Why should I not use Bedrock?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you are happy with all of the functionality provided
						by another Linux distribution, and you have no interest
						in features it does not provide, it would likely be
						best to simply use that other Linux distribution.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you value stability/reliability, note that while
						this is a priority for Bedrock Linux, Bedrock Linux is
						still largely new and untested; a tried-and-true
						stable/reliable Linux distribution such as Debian or a
						Red Hat Enterprise Linux clone would likely be better
						suited.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you value security, note that Bedrock Linux probably
						has the highest attack surface of just about any Linux
						distribution, mostly because its attack surface is the
						sum of the attack surfaces of just about every other
						Linux distribution combined.  While steps can be taken
						to alleviate this to some degree, ultimately, a
						locked-down Bedrock Linux can never truly reach the
						security offered by a locked-down standard Linux
						distribution.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="How is this different from/preferable to using a virtual machine?">How is this different from/preferable to using a virtual machine?</h2>
			<p>
			Bedrock Linux's functionality differs from virtual machines in
			three key ways:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Bedrock's ability to access programs from other Linux
						distributions is largely transparent once set up.  One
						can, for example, have a RSS feed reader from one Linux
						distribution open a link in a browser in another Linux
						distribution, all running in an X11 server from a third
						Linux distribution.  This all happens transparently; it
						all feels like one single cohesive Linux distribution.
						Virtual machines cannot do this type of transparency
						nearly as well.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Bedrock's ability to access programs from other Linux
						distributions has extremely minimal overhead as
						compared to virtual machines.  This is especially true
						with respect to 3D/video acceleration, which "just
						works" (assuming no proprietary driver issues) as well
						as it does in a normal Linux distribution.  Such things
						typically do not work very well at all in virtual
						machines.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Bedrock, by its very design, interweaves other Linux
						distributions together; it ensures they share quite a
						bit.  This means if there is a security vulnerability
						in one of the clients, there is little to stop it from
						affecting the rest of the system.  Virtual machines, by
						their very design, sandbox the clients, such that an
						attack on one of them will have a difficult time
						propagating to others.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="Why is there no proper installer?">Why is there no proper installer?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Creating an proper installer takes more time and effort
						than what Bedrock Linux does.  Due to limits on
						manpower and time, creating a proper installer is a
						relatively low priority.  It'd be nice to have,
						eventually, if everything else on the <a
							href="todo.html">TODO</a> is checked off and the
						issues described below are alleviated.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						It is an easy way to avoid the responsibility
						associated with partitioning or setting up a
						bootloader.  A mistake in the former could easily
						delete valued data, and a mistake in the latter could
						just as easily ruin someone's day in other ways.  By
						only providing instructions, if something goes wrong,
						it is quite easy to just say "I told you to be careful
						at that part" and remove responsibility from the
						Bedrock Linux developer.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						This also removes responsibility for security
						vulnerabilities.  If Bedrock Linux is distributed with
						a package with a security vulnerability, Bedrock Linux
						could potentially be blamed any issues that arise.
						This way the blame would more likely either fall on the
						user or upstream.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						This ensures the user knows how to update core
						components.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="When will $RELEASE be released?">When will $RELEASE be released?</h2>
			<p>
				If there is an estimate for a release, it will be stated in the
				index page for the specific release.  If not, then it will be
				released when it is done.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Why that name?">Why that name?</h2>
			<p>
				Bedrock Linux does not do very much by itself; rather, it is
				the foundation upon which other Linux distributions are placed.
				Initial ideas for a name were intent on reflecting this fact.
				Other proposed names included "Foundation Linux", "Frame Linux"
				and "Scaffolding Linux".  The name chosen has nothing to do
				with the television show <em>The Flintstones</em>.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Where do the release names come from?">Where do the release names come from?</h2>
			<p>
				All of the Bedrock Linux releases are named after characters
				from the Nickelodeon television program <em>Avatar: The Last
				Air Bender</em>.
			</p>
			<h2 id="What are the system requirements?">What are the system requirements?</h2>
			<p>
				The system requirements are listed in the specific pages for
				each release.  This is done in case changes between versions
				alter the system requirements.  The system requirements for the
				initial alpha can be found <a
					href="1.0alpha1/systemrequirements.html">here</a>.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Why does this need to be its own distribution?">Why does this need to be its own distribution?</h2>
			<p>
				For much of Bedrock Linux's development, it was simply a set of
				scripts on top of Debian.  It became apparent, after months of
				using it, that there would be a number of benefits to make this
				its own Linux distribution.  If you do not find any value in
				the items listed here you're more than welcome to try to use
				the Bedrock Linux utilities on top of another distribution.
				<ul>
					<li>
						The base distribution should require minimal
						maintenance over long periods of time.  Ultimately,
						even long-term supported Linux distributions will lose
						support and have to be upgraded or replaced eventually.
						One of the advantages of Bedrock Linux is that these
						distro-upgrade situations can be significantly less
						painful <em>when the distro is a client</em>; however,
						this advantage is not available for the base itself.
						If the base is made to be as minimal as possible, this
						should decrease the amount of things that need to be
						updated and maintained.  As Bedrock Linux approaches
						maturity, this could theoretically be brought down to
						perhaps one or two executables other than the Linux
						kernel itself.  It is difficult to properly express
						just how nice it is to <em>never</em> worry about how a
						major change to how things work under the hood of your
						Linux distribution could possibly take down your
						system, as the vitals of the system remain relatively
						static.
					</li>
					<li>
						The base distribution is effectively entirely overhead.
						Ideally any resource usage (disk space, RAM, CPU, etc)
						should be minimized.  Most major distributions
						available are far larger than necessary, and most
						minimal distributions were found to lack features
						Bedrock would need (as they were intended to be
						entirely minimal, rather than the basis for a
						full-blown desktop/server/etc).  This is particularly
						important on resource-limited devices, such as ASUS
						Eee PC's, where Bedrock Linux's early development and
						usage took place.
					</li>
					<li>
						Much of what Bedrock Linux needs to do to properly
						utilize clients requires direct control over key files,
						such as <code>/etc/profile</code>.  While many Linux
						distributions do offer means to properly remove
						individual files from the package manager's control,
						such as utilizing <code>dpkg-divert</code>, as the
						number of files which need this treatment grow the
						advantages of using an existing distribution shrink.
					</li>
					<li>
						Much of what Bedrock Linux needs to do to properly
						utilize clients requires direct control over what
						happens during boot.  For example, if one would like to
						be able to choose which device manager to use from which
						client, special functionality must be built into the
						boot process to properly handle deciding which device
						manager to call when, if any.  Attempting to integrate
						such functionality into existing boot systems is not an
						appealing task when a (very simple) home-grown init
						could suffice instead.
