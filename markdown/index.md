Bedrock Linux
=============

Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution created with the aim of making most of
the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux
distributions available simultaneously and transparently.

If one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL
clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch
Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentoo's portage, and ensure that
software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at the
same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux will provide a means to
achieve this.  [Watch a

[introduction](introduction.html) and [FAQ](faq.html) for more.

Flopsie plans discussed [here](http://bedrocklinux.org/1.0alpha4/plans.html)
