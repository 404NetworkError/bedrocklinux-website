Bedrock Linux
=============

Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution created with the aim of making most of
the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux
distributions available simultaneously and transparently.

If one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL
clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch
Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentoo's portage, and ensure that
software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at the
same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux will provide a means to
achieve this.  [Watch a

Website overhauled.  Huge thanks to [simonlc](http://simon.lc/) for assisting
me with a new website design.  Note that the website now supports atom, and so
if you would like to follow Bedrock Linux development and news feel free to

<small>2012-11-16</small>

Bosco plans discussed [here](http://bedrocklinux.org/1.0alpha3/plans.html) have
been implemented and show a huge real-world performance boost.  This
functionality was backported to Momo for those who are interested in trying it
out before Bosco is ready.  See
[here](http://bedrocklinux.org/1.0alpha2/backports.html) for benchmarks and
instructions on how to install the backport update.
