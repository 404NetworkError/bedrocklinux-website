Bedrock Linux
=============

Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution created with the aim of making most of
the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux
distributions available simultaneously and transparently.

If one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL
clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch
Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentoo's portage, and ensure that
software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at the
same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux will provide a means to
achieve this.  [Watch a

[introduction](introduction.html) and [FAQ](faq.html) for more.

  before release)

## {id="early-2014-plans"} Early 2014 plans
<small>2014-01-14</small>

The plan for Bedrock Linux development in the coming months revolves around
functionality which can be added without significant under-the-hood changes to
Bedrock Linux.  Various ideas currently being worked on:

- Additional research on recommended/default client settings.
- Man pages for Bedrock Linux utilities.
- Tab-completion in bash and zsh for Bedrock Linux utilities.
- A replacement for the current brp which will update on-the-fly.
- A new utility, brg ("BedRock Get"), which will be used to easily acquire
  clients.
- A new utility, brm ("BedRock Manual"), which can be used to find a man page.
  available in at least one client, irrelevant of which client provides it.
- A new utility, pmm ("Package Manager Manager"), which will abstract away
  client-specific package management.
- A new utility, iss ("Init System System"), which will abstract away
  individual client init system differences.
