## {id="bosco_performance"} Bosco performance boosted; backported to Momo
<small>2012-11-16</small>

Bosco plans discussed [here](http://bedrocklinux.org/1.0alpha3/plans.html) have
been implemented and show a huge real-world performance boost.  This
functionality was backported to Momo for those who are interested in trying it
out before Bosco is ready.  See
[here](http://bedrocklinux.org/1.0alpha2/backports.html) for benchmarks and
instructions on how to install the backport update.
